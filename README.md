# EEG-source-and-FC-analyses
EEG Source-Reconstruction and Spatial Downsampling for Functional Connectivity analyses

This repository includes the code scripts written by Nora Hagopian during her master's research project at the Department of Integrative Neurophysiology, CNCR, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam under supervision of dr. Klaus Linkenkaer-Hansen and Simon Houtman.

READ the MANUAL of the scripts available in the repository to guide you along the available scripts for EEG functional ocnnectivity source-reconstruction analyses. The source-reconstruction is executed using the open-source application: Brainstorm (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction).

The provided code is apllicable in MATLAB. 

Please contact: norahagopian@hotmail.com if you are interested in receiving her master's thesis or have any questions regarding the code.
